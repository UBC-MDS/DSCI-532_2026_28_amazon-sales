# Group 28 – Team Work Contract

## Expectations

Each team member is expected to contribute approximately **three hours** toward the project each week, including the lab session. Work will be divided into three parts, and members will select the tasks they feel most comfortable with. All deliverables should follow the project instructions carefully, including clear writing, accurate analysis, and complete updates to the GitHub repository.

If a team member anticipates difficulty completing their portion on time, they must communicate with the group **at least half a day before the meeting** so work can be adjusted if needed.

## Meetings

Meeting times were agreed on during our first team discussion. The team will meet on the following schedule:

-   **Thursday:** 2:00 PM – 3:30 PM

### Meeting Plan

-   Finalize the work contract

-   Divide tasks

-   Outline what must be completed before the next meeting

All members are expected to attend meetings. If someone cannot attend, they must provide written notice at least half a day beforehand.

## Communication

All group communication will take place through **Slack** and **GitHub**.

-   **Slack:** Used for coordinating meetings, quick updates, and general team communication.

-   **GitHub:** Used for all project-related discussions, sharing work, giving feedback, and reviewing pull requests.

Team members are expected to check both platforms regularly and respond within a reasonable time.

## Reviews

All contributions must be submitted to the shared repository through pull requests.

-   Each pull request must include at least one teammate as a reviewer.

-   Reviewers should provide feedback or approval within **24 hours**.

-   Work should be clean, complete, and ready for review before a pull request is opened.

## Roles

To ensure consistent quality, the group will rotate the role of **proofreader** in alphabetical order:

1.  Eduardo Sanchez

2.  Hoi Hin Kwok

3.  Yan Xin Liang

The proofreader for the week will review the full submission on **Saturday**, ensure it meets all project requirements, and create the final version tag before submission.

## Deadlines

Deadlines for individual items will be assigned during meetings. The proofreader will review the work on Saturday and ensure that the final version is ready for submission and create the required version tag.

## Breach of Contract

If a team member fails to meet the expectations outlined in this contract, the following steps will be taken:

1.  A written message will be sent through Slack describing the concern.

2.  The group will discuss the issue together to clarify expectations and agree on next steps.

3.  If the issue continues, the lab instructor or TA will be contacted for further guidance.
